# Agent Coordination Skill

## Instructions
1. **Define agent roles**
   - UI Agent
   - Auth Agent
   - Backend Agent

2. **Boundaries**
   - One agent = one responsibility
   - No overlap

3. **Communication**
   - Pass clear context
   - Provide expected output format

## Best Practices
- Never let agents guess requirements
- Provide file paths and constraints
