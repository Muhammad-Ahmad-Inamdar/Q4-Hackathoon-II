# Acceptance Criteria Extraction Skill

## Instructions
1. **Identify success conditions**
   - What defines "done" for this feature
   - What must work correctly
   - What must not break
   - Performance/quality thresholds

2. **Make criteria testable**
   - Convert vague requirements to specific tests
   - Define measurable outcomes
   - Specify exact expected values
   - Include edge cases

3. **Structure as test cases**
   - Given [preconditions]
   - When [action performed]
   - Then [expected result]
   - Use concrete examples with real data

4. **Cover all scenarios**
   - Happy path (normal usage)
   - Error cases (invalid input, failures)
   - Edge cases (boundaries, limits)
   - Security/permission checks

5. **Prioritize criteria**
   - Must-have (blocking)
   - Should-have (important)
   - Nice-to-have (optional)

## Best Practices
- Every criterion must be objectively verifiable
- Avoid subjective terms ("fast", "good", "user-friendly")
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Make criteria independent (can test in any order)
- Align criteria with user value and business goals
